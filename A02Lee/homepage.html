                        <p>  I am Gunhee Lee, and I am from South Korea. I transferred to the Northwest Missouri State University in August 2014. 
                            While in Korea, I studied criminology which is totally different from GIS I am studying currently. 
                            Before I came to the United States, I had learned English by myself for two years. 
                            When I got here at first in 2014, I barely spoke English and did not have any knowledge about Cartography 
                            so I had a hard time improving my English and studying Cartography.</p>

                            <p>I am really interested in getting a job in technology field. I was already going to study web programming languages.
                                    I have never learned about HTMl and CSS so, this class would be great chance for me to improve my another programming languages 
                                    such as HTML,CSS and Java Scripts other than other programming languages such as Java, Python and Android.
                                    My goal is to make at least 3 android application until before graduation. </p>

                            <p>I like playing sports such as soccer and basketball. So, I go out every sunday to play soccer 
                                    with maryville soccer team at Donaldson Park.
                                    I am very interested in learning programming languages and want to improve my skills
                                    as much as I can before I graduate. </p>
